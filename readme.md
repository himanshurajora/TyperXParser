## Typerx Parser

Yes as simple as that.

I had some issues while creating the typerx project, so I created this parser library

**What was the problem?**

It was very hard to create diffrent tests because I had to write all code and then replace newlines and tabs with \n and \t.

**How did I solve it?**

Well I just made a simple Parser

I know What you're thinking : ðŸ¤” Hey Himanshu This is technically not a parser, it's just replacing newlines and tabs with \n and \t.

Well my friend you are right and wrong. Technically it is a parser, because it making language conversion.
I am calling that \t\n Programming Language.

``` npm install typerxparser ``` to install the library
